D:\android app\app\build.gradle:15: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk 34
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application or sdk runs on a version of Android that is more
   recent than your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with,
   various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application
   continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the
   targetSdkVersion is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the
   UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:

   Explanation for issues of type "AndroidGradlePluginVersion":
   This detector looks for usage of the Android Gradle Plugin where the
   version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older
   versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick
   with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more
   recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "NewerVersionAvailable":
   This detector checks with a central repository to see if there are newer
   versions available for the dependencies used by this project. This is
   similar to the GradleDependency check, which checks for newer versions
   available in the Android SDK tools and libraries, but this works with any
   MavenCentral dependency, and connects to the library every time, which
   makes it more flexible but also much slower.

D:\android app\app\build.gradle:75: Warning: The native library arm64-v8a/libbarhopper_v3.so (from com.google.mlkit:barcode-scanning:17.2.0) is not 16 KB aligned [Aligned16KB]

   Explanation for issues of type "Aligned16KB":
   Android has traditionally used 4 KB memory page sizes. However, to support
   future devices that only work with 16 KB aligned libraries apps containing
   native libraries need to be built with 16 KB alignment.

   Apps with 4 KB aligned native libraries may not work correctly on devices
   requiring 16 KB alignment. To ensure compatibility and future-proof your
   app, it is strongly recommended that your native libraries are aligned to
   16 KB boundaries.

   If your app uses any NDK libraries, directly or indirectly through an SDK,
   you should rebuild your app to meet this recommendation. Make sure all
   native libraries within your application, including those from
   dependencies, are built with 16 KB page alignment.

   This lint check looks at all native libraries that your app depends on. If
   any are found to be aligned to 4 KB instead of 16 KB, you will need to
   address this.

   When a library is flagged, first try to update to a newer version that
   supports 16 KB alignment. If an updated version is not available, contact
   the library vendor to ask about their plans for 16 KB support and request a
   compatible version. Updating your libraries proactively will help ensure
   your app works properly on a wider range of devices.

D:\android app\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:4: Error: Permission exists without corresponding hardware <uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" required="false"> tag [PermissionImpliesUnsupportedChromeOsHardware]
 <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "PermissionImpliesUnsupportedChromeOsHardware":
   The <uses-permission> element should not require a permission that implies
   an unsupported large screen hardware feature. Google Play assumes that
   certain hardware related permissions indicate that the underlying hardware
   features are required by default. To fix the issue, consider declaring the
   corresponding <uses-feature> element with required="false" attribute.

   Explanation for issues of type "TrustAllX509TrustManager":
   This check looks for X509TrustManager implementations whose
   checkServerTrusted or checkClientTrusted methods do nothing (thus trusting
   any certificate chain) which could result in insecure network traffic
   caused by trusting arbitrary TLS/SSL certificates presented by peers.

D:\android app\app\src\main\java\com\cu\attendance\ImportPreviewScreen.kt:45: Hint: Prefer mutableFloatStateOf instead of mutableStateOf [AutoboxingStateCreation from androidx.compose.runtime]
    var importProgress by remember { mutableStateOf(0f) }
                                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "AutoboxingStateCreation":
   Calling mutableStateOf<T>() when T is either backed by a primitive type on
   the JVM or is a value class results in a state implementation that requires
   all state values to be boxed. This usually causes an additional allocation
   for each state write, and adds some additional work to auto-unbox values
   when reading the value of the state. Instead, prefer to use a specialized
   primitive state implementation for Int, Long, Float, and Double when the
   state does not need to track null values and does not override the default
   SnapshotMutationPolicy.

D:\android app\app\src\main\res\xml\file_paths.xml:2: Warning: The resource R.xml.file_paths appears to be unused [UnusedResources]
<paths xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
^

   Explanation for issues of type "UnusedResources":
   Unused resources make applications larger and slow down builds.


   The unused resource check can ignore tests. If you want to include
   resources that are only referenced from tests, consider packaging them in a
   test source set instead.

   You can include test sources in the unused resource check by setting the
   system property lint.unused-resources.include-tests =true, and to exclude
   them (usually for performance reasons), use
   lint.unused-resources.exclude-tests =true.
   ,

   Available options:

   **skip-libraries** (default is true):
   Whether the unused resource check should skip reporting unused resources in libraries.

   Many libraries will declare resources that are part of the library surface; other modules depending on the library will also reference the resources. To avoid reporting all these resources as unused (in the context of a library), the unused resource check normally skips reporting unused resources in libraries. Instead, run the unused resource check on the consuming app module (along with `checkDependencies=true`).

   However, there are cases where you want to check that all the resources declared in a library are used; in that case, you can disable the skip option.

   To configure this option, use a `lint.xml` file with an <option> like this:

   ```xml
   <lint>
       <issue id="UnusedResources">
           <option name="skip-libraries" value="true" />
       </issue>
   </lint>
   ```
